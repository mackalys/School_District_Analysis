# School_District_Analysis


## Overview
#### The purpose of this project is to take the given data, clean it, and analyze it so the school district can see how their school is performing in math and reading as well as track how much money is being spent at each school. We took the data and made 9 different charts to present to the school district so they could have a comprehensive understanding of how their schools are performing. The analysis includes an overall breakdown of how each school perfdorms, the scores for each school in math and reading scores, the top and bottom performing schools, how the schools perform based on how much money is spent per student, how the schools perform based on the size of the school, and how the schools perform based on the type of school. All the data seen now has been altered from the original analysis. It has come to the attention of the school district that Thomas High School cheated on some their scores so it was requested that all of their scores be replaced NaNs, or "Not a Number". The following are the results of the new analysis.


## Results
### District Summary

After running the analysis again, it can be seen that the data was not altered all that much by the replacement of the Thomas High School Scores. The average math scores dropped from 79.0 to 78.9, average reading scores stayed the same, percentage passing math dropped from 74.9 to 74.8, percentage passing reading rose from 85.5 to 85.7, and percent overall passing dropped from 65.7 to 64.9.

### School Summary, Top Performing Schools, and Bottom Performing Schools

#### Top Performing Schools

#### Bottom Performing Schools

As seen above, the scores were really not all the affected by the changing of the scores listed for Thomas High School. Both the top and bottom perfomorning scores were not affected. The ranking is still the same as it was prior.

#### Average Math and Reading Scores by Grade

![Reading_Scores_by_Grade.png](https://github.com/mackalys/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Resources/Reading_Scores_by_grade.png)

The only real differences we should see here is in the Thomas High School scores. Since we did not combine the scores like we did at the very beginning, the other schools will not be affected.

#### Scores by School Spending

For the first category, <$584, percent passing math increaded .5%, percent passing reading decreased by .4%, and percent overall passing increased by .4% whereas everything remained the same. In the second category, $585-629, everything stayed the same except percent passing math increased by .1%, percent passing reading went down .3%, and percent overall passing increaded by .4%. In the third category, everything remained where it was except percent passing math increased by .5%, percent passing reading decreased by .6%, and percent overall passing decreased by .2%. Finally, in the last category, $645-675, average math and reading scores remained the same, but percent passing math increased by .2%, percent passing reading went up .1%, and percent overall passing went down .5%.

#### Scores by School Size

For all the above categories, small, medium, and large schools, the average math scores and average reading scores remained the same. For small schools, percent passing math went up .4%, percent passing reading went up .1%, and percent overall passing increased by .1%. For medium sized schools, the scores for percent passing math and percent overall passing went down .4% and percent passing reading went down .1%. Lastly for the large sdchools, percent passing reading went down .2% and percent overall passing decreased by .3%.

#### Scores by School Type
![Type_Summary.png](https://github.com/mackalys/school_district_analysis/blob/main/Resources/Type_Summary.png)

For both the district category and charter category, average math and reading scores stayed the same. for charter schools, percent passing math went down .4%, percent passing reading went down .9% and percent overall passing went down .4%. For district schools, percent passing math went down .5%, percent passing reading went down .2%, and percent overall passing went down .3%.

## Summary
From looking at the data before we changed the scores for Thomas High School, there are not huge difference in the scores. Still, with the large dataset we were given any change should be noted. There appears to not be one trend after changing the data. Some of the scores increased and some decreased, but nothing that would cause a huge change in the standing or ranks of the schools after altering the data for Thomas High School.
